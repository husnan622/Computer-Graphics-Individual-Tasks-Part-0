# Computer Graphics Individual Tasks Part 0
## Create a WebGL-based Graphics application with the following specifications:
1. The application is composed of HTML and JavaScript files.
2. The application consists of only one Canvas.
3. The JavaScript application contains definitions of the vertices that make up the shape of the dispenser.
4. The definition of a vertex includes elements: position (x, y) and color (r, g, b), as they appear on the dispenser.
5. The shape as shown in the dispenser is drawn on the left side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between the X = -1.0 and X = 0.0 axes.
6. The shape as shown in the dispenser is drawn on the right side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between the X = 0.0 and X = 1.0 axes.
7. The resulting image on the Canvas on the right is animated vertically, bouncing between the top and bottom walls of the Canvas, at a speed of 0.0xxx units.
